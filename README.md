## About Delcious Handrawn

Delicious Handrawn is a font that was created because it was inspired by my own handwriting that I want to make a font, I started by making all the glyphs on my ipad using the procreate application, the challenge for me when making the font is my own handwriting which is not neat and it makes me have to repeat many times until I find the stroke that fits in my opinion.

## About

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://alphArtype.github.io/Delicious.
